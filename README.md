haskell-casestt
===============

A couple case studies to compare haskell to dependently typed languages:
  - relational-algebra: an interface to a database (SQLite) with strong static
    			guarantees
    Not implemented yet.
  - RedBlackTree: an implementation of red-black trees in haskell in which the
                  red-black tree invariants are encoded in the types
  - koopa: a representation of paths that are restricted by their type
           based on the difference between red and green koopa troopas
